*Ahh.. Once again, I feel the smooth touch of the night on my old skin.*  
*And thirst. The second thing I notice, as usual.* **-smirks-**  
*There's yet a different vibe in the air. I've opened my eyes into a different world, perhaps.*  
*We'll see..*  
**-looks at the now-dead-girl in his arms-**  
*These wounds.. It was not I who did this, yet somehow, it led to my resurrection.*  
*I wonder.. Have someone bled this poor soul here intentionally?*  
*Or was it just an act of fate?*  
*Hmm.. Perhaps it's irrelevant.*  
*The only thing that matters is; I walk the earth again.*  
**-his visage slowly fades into the darkness as incomprehensible whispers are heard-**  
**-a distinct whisper is heard just before he disappears though-**  
*"For now, keep it low.. and please, don't forget to act like you are breathing."*
